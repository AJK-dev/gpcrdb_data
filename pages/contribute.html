            <p>The GPCRdb already contains the largest available set of GPCR mutants and the goal is to continuously
            deposit mutants into GPCRdb, now also capturing the pharmacological effect.</p>
            <p>You can contribute to the mutational data available in GPCRdb, e.g. with data from your own lab to
            increase the visibility and thus the number of citations. You can also contribute with data sets gathered
            from the literature, which can be put into perspective by comparing to mutational effects in e.g. other GPCR
            subtypes by use of the visualization tools available in GPCRdb. To capture mutational data in a format that
            enables comparison of effect on e.g. ligand binding affinity, a standardized Excel spreadsheet has been
            prepared to collect the data. Please
            <a href='/static/home/images/pages/contribute_mutants/excel_file_for_reporting_mutants.xlsx'>download it here</a>, enter your data by
            following the instructions included in each cell and email the file to
            <a href='mailto:kasper.harpsoe@sund.ku.dk'>Kasper Harpsøe</a> (uploading functionality is under construction
            and will be available soon).</p> 

            <p>A few examples of entered mutant data are
            <a href='/static/home/images/pages/contribute_mutants/excel_file_for_reporting_mutants_examples.xlsx'>available here</a> and if in doubt please
            contact <a href='mailto:kasper.harpsoe@sund.ku.dk'>Kasper Harpsøe</a> via e-mail.</p>

            <h3>Type of mutation data</h3>
            <p>The current standardized Excel spreadsheet is made for reporting mutational effects on ligand binding and
            function but additionally contains the possibility to report mutational effect on surface expression, basal
            activity and Emax.</p>

            <p>Future plans for the GPCRdb mutational database includes the possibility to receive and display data for
            mutations with effect on thermo-stabilization, biased signaling, G-protein binding and dimerization and more
            may be added.</p>

            <h3>How will the mutation data be used?</h3>
            <p>Through the GPCRdb it will be possible to browse and search the mutation database for e.g. mutations in a
            given receptor or sub-family of receptors, mutations in a given generic numbering position, mutations with
            effect on a given ligand or ligand class (and much more). It will also be possible to download the mutation
            data of interest in a comma-separated format including all entered data and links to references.</p>

            <p>Our main focus is on how mutants affect ligand binding and function. Thus, the first visualization tools
            that will be available in the GPCRdb are snake and helix box diagrams for mapping mutated residues on the
            7-TM domain plus tables for comparing mutated residues across receptor subtypes. Both diagrams and tables 
            can be color-coded according to the fold-effect of the mutation on the desired ligand property (binding or
            effect – see examples). It will soon be possible to combine the diagrams and table with information on
            ligand-interacting residues annotated from crystal structures to give a structural explanation for the
            observed mutational effect. Furthermore, it is the intention that future versions of GPCRdb tools will
            additionally offer mapping of mutational data on crystal structures and homology models in 3D.</p>
