                <header><h3>Alignments</h3></header>
                <p>The "Alignments" tool allows for alignment of user selected receptors and sequence segments.</p>
                <p>Using the tool is a two step process. The user is first presented with a receptor selection page. Receptors
                can be selected individually or by family. The user can select as many receptors as he/she wishes (WARNING: selecting a
                large number of receptors increases loading time).</p>
                <p>After receptors have been selected, the user is presented with a sequence segment selection page. The user can
                select one or more sequence segments, and/or expand each segment to select the residues within it individually. Residues
                selected individually are grouped into a custom sequence segment.</p>
                <p>After completing these two steps, an alignment is displayed. To display the sequence number of an aligned residue, as
                well as generic number indices, hover the mouse over it. At the bottom of the page, a consensus sequence as well as conservation
                statistics for amino acids and chemical features are displayed.</p>

                <p>The "Residue numbers" tool allows for conversion of generic numbering schemes for GPCRs.</p>
                <p>Using the tool is a one step process. The user is first presented with a receptor selection page.
                Receptors can be selected individually or by family. The user can select as many receptors as he/she
                wishes (WARNING: selecting a large number of receptors increases loading time).</p>
                <p>After receptors have been selected, a conversion table is displayed. The first columns show the
                indices for the generic number schemes (Available schemes are: GPCRDB[1], Sequence based class
                specific schemes (Ballesteros-Weinstein[2], Wootten[3], Pin[4] and Wang[5]), Oliveira[6], and
                Baldwin/Schwartz[7,8]), and the following columns show the sequence numbers that correspond to each
                generic number for the selected receptors.
