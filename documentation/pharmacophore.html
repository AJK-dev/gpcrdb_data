             <h4>Abstract</h4>

             <p>We have developed a new method for the building of pharmacophores for G protein-coupled receptors, a
             major drug target family. The method is a combination of the ligand- and target-based pharmacophore
             methods and founded on the extraction of structural fragments, interacting ligand moiety and receptor
             residue pairs, from crystal structure complexes. We describe the procedure to collect a library with more
             than 250 fragments covering 29 residue positions within the generic transmembrane binding pocket. We
             describe how the library fragments are recombined and inferred to build pharmacophores for new targets. A
             validating retrospective virtual screening of histamine H1 and H3 receptor pharmacophores yielded
             area-under-the-curves of 0.88 and 0.82, respectively. The fragment-based method has the unique advantage
             that it can be applied to targets for which no (homologous) crystal structures or ligands are known. 47%
             of the class A G protein-coupled receptors can be targeted with at least four-element pharmacophores. The
             fragment libraries can also be used to grow known ligands or for rotamer refinement of homology models.
             Researchers can download the complete fragment library or a subset matching their receptor of interest
             using our new tool in GPCRdb.</p>

                        residue position, the included residues (top), associated pharmacophore elements and

                        receptors (bottom). In the matching to class A sequences, similar residues are only 
                        those that can orient the interacting atoms in the same place; e.g. Ser and Thr for 
                        hydrogen bonds; His, Phe, Trp and Tyr for an aromatic edge/face-to-face interactions; 
                        and Phe for Tyr face-to-edge interactions..
