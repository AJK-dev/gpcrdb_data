Structure-based alignments
--------------------------

The "Structure-based alignments" tool allows for alignment of user selected receptors and sequence segments.
Using the tool is a two step process. The user is first presented with a receptor selection page. Receptors
can be selected individually or by family. The user can select as many receptors as he/she wishes (WARNING: selecting
a large number of receptors increases loading time).

After receptors have been selected, the user is presented with a sequence segment selection page. The user can
select one or more sequence segments, and/or expand each segment to select the residues within it individually.
Residues selected individually are grouped into a custom sequence segment.

After completing these two steps, an alignment is displayed. To display the sequence number of an aligned residue, as
well as generic numbers, hover the mouse over it. At the bottom of the page, a consensus sequence as well as
conservation statistics for amino acids and chemical features are displayed.
