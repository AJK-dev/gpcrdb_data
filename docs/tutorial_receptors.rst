Receptors and sequences
=======================

Receptors pages
---------------

This video demonstrates how to use the receptor pages.

* By moving the pointer over residues in the sequence viewer, more information can be displayed.

* Snake and Helix box plots can be custom colored and downloaded.

* A summary of available mutant data is displayed, and a link provided for further analysis.

* Available structure information is listed.

Structure-based sequence alignments
-----------------------------------

This video demonstrates how to build a structure-based sequence alignment.

* Any combination of receptors and/or receptor families can be selected.

* It is possible to limit the alignment to a particular part of the sequence, e.g. TM6.

* By moving the pointer over residues in the alignment, more information can be displayed.

* A consensus sequence (color coded by conservation) is displayed below the alignment.

* Statistics on residue and residue property conservation is displayed below the consensus sequence.
