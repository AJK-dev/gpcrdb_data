Structures
=================

Structure browser
-----------------

The structure table shows an annotated list of published GPCR structures. The table can be sorted by each
column by clicking on the header. The search fields below each header can be used to filter the structures, e.g.
show only those with a co-crystallized agonist or X-ray resolution &lt; 2.5 Å.

To view an alignment of the structures' sequences, click the "View alignment" button.

Template selection
------------------

Using the template selection tool is a one step process. The user is first presented with a reference receptor selection
page. The selected reference receptor will be compared to the published GPCR structures, making it a useful tool
for selecting templates for homology modeling.

Once a reference receptor has been selected, an annotated table of published GPCR structures, ranked by
similarity to the selected reference receptor is shown. The table can be sorted by each column by clicking on the header.
The search fields below each header can be used to filter the structures, e.g. show only those with a co-crystallized
agonist or X-ray resolution &lt; 2.5 Å.
